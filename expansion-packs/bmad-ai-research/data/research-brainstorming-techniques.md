# Research Brainstorming Techniques

## Research Question Generation

1. **Gap Analysis**: Start with known limitations → What hasn't been solved? Why?
2. **What If Scenarios**: "What if transformers could X?" → Novel capabilities
3. **Problem Inversion**: "What if we DON'T need X?" → Challenge assumptions
4. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: "How do biologists solve this?" → Apply to AI/ML
5. **Scaling Questions**: "What breaks at 1000x scale?" → Identify bottlenecks

## Novelty Discovery

6. **Assumption Challenge**: List all assumptions → Reverse each → What becomes possible?
7. **Component Recombination**: Take existing pieces → New arrangements → Novel architectures
8. **Constraint Relaxation**: "What if we had infinite compute/data?" → Then work backward
9. **Failure Analysis**: Study why methods fail → Turn failures into research opportunities
10. **Interdisciplinary Bridge**: Connect two unrelated fields → Find overlaps

## Literature-Driven Ideation

11. **Citation Trail Brainstorm**: Follow citations both ways → Find unexplored connections
12. **Survey Gap Identification**: Read surveys → List what they say needs work
13. **Replication Crisis**: What can't be reproduced? → Why? → New research
14. **Benchmark Limitations**: What do benchmarks NOT measure? → New evaluation paradigms
15. **Method Comparison**: Why does A work here but B there? → Deeper understanding

## Hypothesis Formation

16. **Ablation Brainstorm**: "What if we remove component X?" → Predict outcomes
17. **Mechanism Exploration**: "HOW does this actually work?" → Propose explanations
18. **Counter-Intuitive Questions**: "What if we do the OPPOSITE?" → Test priors
19. **Transfer Hypotheses**: "Will this work on domain Y?" → Generalization questions
20. **Causal Reasoning**: "What CAUSES the improvement?" → Mechanistic understanding

## Impact-Oriented Thinking

21. **Application Reverse Engineering**: Start with impact → Work backward to methods
22. **Bottleneck Identification**: What limits real-world deployment? → Research to remove limits
23. **Ethical Implications**: What could go wrong? → Proactive safety research
24. **Efficiency Focus**: "Can we do this 10x faster/cheaper?" → Practical impact
25. **Democratization**: "How can non-experts use this?" → Accessibility research

## Collaborative Exploration

26. **Role Perspectives**: Think as: theorist, practitioner, user, reviewer → Different angles
27. **Five Whys**: Ask "why" 5 times → Get to fundamental research questions
28. **"Yes, And..." Building**: One person's idea → Another builds → Collaborative ideation
29. **Provocative Statements**: "Deep learning is just memorization" → Debate → Insights
30. **Question Storming**: Generate 50 questions → Don't answer yet → Find patterns

## Advanced Research Techniques

31. **Meta-Analysis Brainstorm**: Look at many papers → Find meta-patterns → New insights
32. **Paradigm Questioning**: "Is the current approach fundamentally limited?" → New paradigms
33. **Resource Reallocation**: "If we spent effort on Y instead of X?" → Alternative directions
34. **Temporal Projection**: "What will matter in 5 years?" → Future-proof research
35. **Simplification Challenge**: "What's the simplest version that could work?" → Core insights

## Techniques for Refinement

36. **Specificity Drill**: Make vague ideas concrete → Testable hypotheses
37. **Feasibility Check**: Can we actually test this? → Practical constraints
38. **Impact Assessment**: Would this actually matter? → Importance evaluation
39. **Novelty Verification**: Has this been done? → Quick literature spot-check
40. **Collaboration Mapping**: Who could help? → What expertise needed?

## Discovery Mode (Early Stage)

When you don't know what to research yet:

- **Curiosity-Driven**: What genuinely confuses or interests you?
- **Literature Immersion**: Read broadly → Note what excites you
- **Problem Collection**: Keep running list of interesting problems
- **Conference Scanning**: What are people excited about? Why?
- **Discussion-Based**: Talk to peers → What do they think is important?

## Refinement Mode (Narrowing Down)

When you have rough ideas:

- **Hypothesis Sharpening**: Make claims specific and testable
- **Feasibility Reality Check**: Can we actually do this?
- **Impact Validation**: Will anyone care about this result?
- **Novelty Check**: Thoroughly search for related work
- **Resource Planning**: What do we need to execute this?

## Iteration Mode (After Literature Review)

When literature reveals gaps:

- **Gap Prioritization**: Which gaps matter most?
- **Approach Brainstorm**: How could we address this gap?
- **Differentiation**: How is our approach different/better?
- **Validation Strategy**: How will we prove it works?
- **Contribution Clarity**: What exactly are we adding?
