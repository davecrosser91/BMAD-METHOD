# README Revision Summary - Deep Research Integration

## Changes Made

The README has been comprehensively revised to clearly distinguish between **two complementary research methodologies** and properly explain the parallel subagent architecture in the deep research workflow.

## Key Revisions

### 1. Two-Methodology Framework

**Before:** Deep research was added as a feature but not clearly distinguished from the existing academic paper workflow.

**After:** Clear separation into two distinct methodologies:

- **METHOD 1: Agentic Deep Research Workflow** - For literature/information gathering
- **METHOD 2: Academic Paper Development Workflow** - For publishing papers with experiments

### 2. Parallel Subagent Architecture (Method 1)

**Added comprehensive explanation of:**

```
Research Lead (Orchestrator)
    │
    ├─→ Spawns 3 parallel subagent workers:
    │   ├─ D. Freuzer (Web Specialist) ──────┐
    │   ├─ H. Zoppel (ArXiv Specialist) ─────┤ Work simultaneously
    │   └─ A. Pilz (KB Curator) ─────────────┘
    │
    └─→ Synthesizes results from all workers
```

**Key points clarified:**

- Research Lead acts as **orchestrator**
- Three specialists act as **parallel worker subagents**
- All three execute searches **simultaneously** during Phase 2 (Exploration)
- 3x faster than sequential search
- Scalable architecture (can spawn more workers if needed)

### 3. Comparison Table

Added detailed comparison table showing when to use each method:

| Feature           | Method 1                            | Method 2                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Goal              | Information gathering               | Paper publication             |
| Timeline          | 4-8 hours                           | 3-6 months                    |
| Architecture      | **Orchestrator + parallel workers** | Sequential coordination       |
| Three Specialists | **Parallel workers (simultaneous)** | Iterative cycles (2-4 rounds) |
| Experiments       | None                                | Novel experiments required    |

### 4. Iterative vs Parallel Distinction

**Method 1 (Deep Research):**

- Phase 2: Three specialists work as **parallel subagent workers**
- Execute searches **simultaneously**
- Focus: Comprehensive information gathering

**Method 2 (Paper Development):**

- Phase 1: Three specialists work through **iterative brainstorming-literature cycles**
- 2-4 rounds of refinement
- Focus: Progressive research question refinement

### 5. Integration Guidance

Added clear guidance on using both methods together:

```bash
# Step 1: Deep research first (4-8 hours)
@research-lead
*run-deep-research "your research area"
# → Comprehensive landscape analysis with gap identification

# Step 2: Then start paper development workflow
@research-lead
*run-phase-1 "focused research topic based on gaps found"
# → Brainstorming with deep research insights
```

## Visual Enhancements

### Architecture Diagrams

**Method 1 - Parallel Subagents:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Research Lead (Orchestrator)         │
│    • Spawn subagent workers             │

│    • Synthesize results                 │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘

**Method 2 - Iterative Cycles:**

```
Research Lead → Three Specialists → Synthesis
                     ↓
                 (Iteration 1)
                     ↓
Research Lead → Three Specialists → Synthesis
                     ↓
                 (Iteration 2)
                     ↓
                  [Repeat 2-4 times]
