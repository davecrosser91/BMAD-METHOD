- Continuous learning and improvement

## Integration with Existing System

### Three-Specialist Research Assistant System

The deep research workflow leverages the existing three-specialist architecture:

- **D. Freuzer** (@research-assistant-web) - Web content, blogs, GitHub
- **H. Zoppel** (@research-assistant-arxiv) - ArXiv papers, academic pre-prints
- **A. Pilz** (@research-assistant-kb) - Knowledge base, curated corpus

All three specialists work in **parallel** during the exploration phase, coordinated by the Research Lead.

### Existing Research Workflows

The deep research workflow complements existing workflows:

- **Phase 1 Planning** - Use deep research BEFORE creating research proposal
- **Literature Review** - Comprehensive coverage for paper related work section
- **Experiment Design** - Thorough background research before experiments
- **Grant Writing** - Evidence-based gap identification

### MCP Integration

Full integration with existing MCP servers:

- **Archon MCP** - Knowledge base search, document management
- **ArXiv MCP** - Academic paper search (optional, graceful fallback)
- **wandb MCP** - Experiment tracking (used in later research phases)

## Usage

### Basic Invocation

```bash
@research-lead
*run-deep-research "your research topic or question"
```

The Research Lead will:

1. Decompose the question into 3-7 sub-questions
2. Generate optimized search queries (2-5 keywords each)
3. Coordinate parallel search across three specialists
4. Analyze and rank information
5. Synthesize comprehensive report
6. Assess quality and iterate if needed

### Example Use Cases

**Technology Investigation:**

```bash
*run-deep-research "efficient attention mechanisms for transformers"
```

**Business Intelligence:**

```bash
*run-deep-research "AI regulation trends in healthcare 2024"
```

**Academic Literature Review:**

```bash
*run-deep-research "self-supervised learning for computer vision"
```

**Competitive Analysis:**

```bash
*run-deep-research "vector database landscape 2024"
```

## Outputs

After completion, the workflow produces:

**Primary Deliverables:**

- `deep-research-report.md` - Comprehensive findings by sub-question
- `executive-summary.md` - 1-page high-level overview
- `bibliography.md` - Complete source list with quality ratings

**Supporting Artifacts:**

## Best Practices

### Query Construction

- Keep queries **SHORT** (2-5 keywords max) - CRITICAL!
- Focus on technical terms and specific concepts
- Avoid filler words ("how to", "implement", "example")
- For multi-concept searches, do multiple focused queries

### Source Evaluation

- Prioritize credible, authoritative sources
- Check publication dates for currency
- Verify author expertise and credentials
- Cross-reference claims across multiple sources

### Synthesis

- Go beyond simple aggregation
- Create meaningful connections between findings
- Acknowledge contradictions and uncertainties
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations

### Iteration

- Don't hesitate to loop back for deeper investigation
- Quality assessment is critical before finalization
- User feedback guides refinement direction
- Document lessons learned for future research
