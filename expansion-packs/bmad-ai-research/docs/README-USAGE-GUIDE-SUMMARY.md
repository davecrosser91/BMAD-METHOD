# README Usage Guide - Summary of Additions

## Problem Identified

The README showed **what** the deep research workflow does and **why** it's useful, but didn't clearly explain **how to actually use it** - especially:

- What happens at each phase
- When user input is needed
- How to interact at decision points
- What to expect as output
- How to iterate if needed

## Solution Implemented

Added comprehensive "How to Use" sections with:

### 1. "How to Use the Workflow" Section

**Step-by-step walkthrough** showing:

```bash
Step 1: Activate Research Lead
@research-lead

Step 2: Start Deep Research
*run-deep-research "your research topic"

Step 3: Watch the workflow execute
[Shows what you'll see at each phase]

Step 4: Make decision at refinement point
[Shows the decision prompt you'll receive]

Step 5: Receive deliverables
[Shows the file structure you'll get]
```

### 2. Visual Progress Indicators

Added **"what you'll see"** for each phase:

**Phase 1: Planning**

```
Research Lead analyzing your question...
├─ Intent: [identified]
├─ Scope: [defined]
└─ Sub-questions generated:
    1. [question]
    2. [question]
    ...
```

**Phase 2: Exploration**

```
Research Lead spawning parallel workers...

D. Freuzer (Web) searching:
├─ Query 1: [keywords]
└─ Found: 15 sources

H. Zoppel (ArXiv) searching:
└─ Found: 8 papers

A. Pilz (KB) searching:
└─ Found: 5 papers
```

This gives users a clear mental model of what's happening.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Interaction

**Clear explanation of the decision point:**

```
⚠️ YOUR INPUT NEEDED:

Research Complete - Quality Assessment

Report addresses 5 sub-questions with 28 sources
Quality scores: 8-9/10

What refinement is needed?

1. Complete - Research meets needs
2. Deeper exploration - Need more info
3. Reframe question - Refine question
4. Expand synthesis - Better integration
5. Other - Specify

Your choice: _____
```

**What each option does:**

- Option 1: Finalize and deliver
- Option 2: Iterate Phase 2 with refined queries
- Option 3: Iterate Phase 1 with new sub-questions
- Option 4: Iterate Phase 4 with better integration

### 4. Complete Worked Example

**Real-world scenario:** "Vector database landscape 2024"

Shows the **entire journey** from start to finish:

1. Initial question
2. Sub-questions generated (5 specific questions)
3. Parallel workers in action (32 sources found)
4. Analysis and synthesis
5. Decision point and choice made
6. Final deliverables received

**Includes:**

- Specific sub-questions generated
- Which worker found what
- What the final report contains
- Total time taken (6 hours)

### 5. Iteration Examples

**Three iteration scenarios explained:**

**Option 1: Deeper Exploration (Most Common)**

```
You: "Need more details on enterprise deployment"
Research Lead: Spawns workers for targeted deep-dive
Result: Additional 12 sources, new section added
```

**Option 2: Reframe Question**

```
You: "Focus specifically on open-source solutions"
Research Lead: Generates new sub-questions
Result: Entire workflow restarts with refined focus
```

**Option 3: Expand Synthesis**

```
You: "Connect features to use cases more clearly"
Research Lead: Re-synthesizes with mapping
Result: Feature-to-use-case matrix added
```

**Typical iteration pattern shown:**

- First iteration (4-8 hours): Broad landscape
- Second iteration (2-4 hours): Deeper dive
- Third iteration (1-2 hours): Final refinements

## User Benefits

### Before (What Was Missing)

Users saw:

- ✅ The command to run
- ✅ What the workflow produces
- ❌ What happens during execution
- ❌ When they need to interact
- ❌ How to make decisions at gates
- ❌ How to iterate effectively

### After (What's Now Clear)

Users now see:

- ✅ Exact commands to run
- ✅ Visual progress at each phase
- ✅ **When and how to provide input**
- ✅ **What each decision option does**
- ✅ **Complete worked example**
- ✅ **How to iterate effectively**
- ✅ What deliverables they'll receive

## Structure of Usage Documentation

### 1. Quick Start (3 lines)

```bash
@research-lead
*run-deep-research "your topic"
```

### 2. High-Level Overview (5 steps)

What the workflow does in summary

### 3. Detailed "How to Use" (Step-by-step)

- Activation
- Execution
- What you'll see at each phase
- Decision point interaction
- Deliverables

### 4. Complete Worked Example

- Real scenario from start to finish
- Concrete outputs
- Time taken

### 5. Iteration Scenarios

- Three common iteration patterns
- What to do in each case
- Expected results

### 6. Use Cases (Quick reference)

- Technology investigation
- Business intelligence
- Academic literature review
- Competitive analysis

## Key Improvements

### Clear Human-in-the-Loop Point

**Before:** Not clear when user input is needed

**After:**

```
⚠️ YOUR INPUT NEEDED:

[Shows exactly what prompt you'll see]
[Shows what each option means]
[Shows what happens after each choice]
```

### Visual Execution Flow

**Before:** Abstract description of phases

**After:** Concrete visualization of what you'll see:

```
D. Freuzer (Web) searching:
├─ Query 1: [keywords]
└─ Found: 15 sources
```

### Concrete Deliverables

**Before:** List of deliverable names

**After:**

```
deep-research-vector-db-2024/
├── deep-research-report.md
    - Comprehensive 15-page report
    - All 5 sub-questions answered
    - 32 sources cited
    [shows what's IN each file]
```

### Iteration Guidance

**Before:** Not clear how to iterate

**After:** Three concrete scenarios showing:

- When to use each iteration option
- What you tell the Research Lead
- What happens next
- What you get as result

## Documentation Flow

The usage documentation now follows a perfect learning progression:

1. **Quick Start** - Get started immediately
2. **Overview** - Understand what will happen
3. **Detailed Steps** - See execution details
4. **Worked Example** - Learn from complete scenario
5. **Iteration Guide** - Handle refinements
6. **Use Cases** - Apply to your situation

## Impact

### For First-Time Users

- Clear onboarding path
- Know what to expect at each step
- Understand when to interact
- See concrete example before starting

### For Experienced Users

- Quick reference for iteration options
- Clear decision framework
- Time estimates for planning

### For Decision-Makers

## Summary

The README now provides a **complete usage guide** that transforms users from:

**"This sounds interesting, but how do I actually use it?"**

To:

**"I know exactly how to run this, what I'll see, when I need to interact, and how to iterate!"**

The key was adding:

1. ✅ Visual progress indicators
2. ✅ Human-in-the-loop explanation
3. ✅ Complete worked example
4. ✅ Iteration scenarios
5. ✅ Concrete deliverables

Users can now **confidently execute the workflow** knowing exactly what to expect at each step.
