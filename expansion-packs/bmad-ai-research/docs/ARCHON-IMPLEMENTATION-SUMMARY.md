## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Architecture

- **Code in Git** - Source code, tests stay in version control
- **Documents in Archon** - All planning, specs, results in Archon
- **Metadata in Archon, Raw Data in wandb** - Best tool for each job

### 2. Document Types Mapping

| Research Document         | Archon Type | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Research Proposal         | `spec`      | Formal specifications       |
| Experimental Architecture | `design`    | System/model designs        |
| Experiment Results        | `note`      | Observations and findings   |
| Technical Stack           | `guide`     | How-to guides and standards |
| Research Project Brief    | `note`      | Context and background      |

### 3. Task Granularity

- **Research projects** → One task per experiment (not per implementation step)
- Each experiment = one Archon task
- Task status flow: `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
- Only ONE task in 'doing' at a time

### 4. Traceability

Every element is linked:

```
Research Question (in Proposal)
    ↓ (addresses)
Experimental Architecture
    ↓ (references)
Experiment Specification
    ↓ (implements)
Archon Task
    ↓ (produces)
Experiment Results
    ↓ (analyzed in)
Statistical Analysis
    ↓ (written in)
Paper Section
```
