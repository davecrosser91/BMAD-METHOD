# Automated Story Pipeline Task

## Purpose

Automate the complete workflow from PRD + Architecture documents to enriched story files with optional GitHub integration. This task orchestrates the PO + SM workflow to create technically enriched stories optimized for AI development.

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**

- You have a completed PRD and Architecture in your project
- You want to create enriched story files (not just basic GitHub issues)
- You need stories with full technical context for AI development
- You want guidance through the optimal workflow
- You're ready to transition from planning to development

**Don't use this task when:**

- PRD or Architecture are not yet complete
- You want simple GitHub issues without enrichment (use PM agent directly)
- You only have 1-2 stories (just use SM agent manually)

## Prerequisites Validation

Before starting, verify:

- [ ] PRD exists at `docs/prd.md` or specified location
- [ ] Architecture exists at `docs/architecture.md` or specified location
- [ ] `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` is configured for your project
- [ ] GitHub CLI (`gh`) is authenticated (if using GitHub integration)
- [ ] Git repository is initialized

## Task Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery and Validation

#### Step 1.1: Load Configuration

1. Read `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
2. Extract key settings:
   - `prdVersion`, `prdSharded`, `prdShardedLocation`
   - `architectureVersion`, `architectureSharded`, `architectureShardedLocation`
   - `devStoryLocation`
   - `markdownExploder` setting

#### Step 1.2: Locate Documents

1. Check for PRD:
   - If `prdSharded: true` ‚Üí Verify sharded location exists
   - If `prdSharded: false` ‚Üí Verify monolithic PRD exists
   - Prompt user for location if not found

2. Check for Architecture:
   - If `architectureSharded: true` ‚Üí Verify sharded location exists
   - If `architectureSharded: false` ‚Üí Verify monolithic Architecture exists
   - Prompt user for location if not found

#### Step 1.3: Count Stories

1. If PRD is sharded, count epic files and stories within each
2. If PRD is monolithic, parse epics and count stories
3. Display summary to user:
   ```
   üìä Project Summary:
   - Total Epics: 4
   - Total Stories: 23
   - Estimated enriched story files to create: 23
   ```

#### Step 1.4: User Confirmation

Present options to user:

```
üéØ Automated Story Pipeline Options:

1. **Full Automation** - Create all enriched story files automatically
2. **Guided Mode** - Pause for approval after each story
3. **Selective Mode** - Choose which epics/stories to process
4. **Dry Run** - Preview what will be created without creating files
5. **Cancel** - Exit and run manually

Which mode would you prefer? (1-5)
```

---

### Phase 2: Document Sharding (if needed)

#### Step 2.1: Check Sharding Status

If documents are NOT already sharded:

```
üìÇ Documents need to be sharded for optimal story creation.

Sharding will:
‚úÖ Break PRD into epic-specific files
‚úÖ Break Architecture into component-specific files
‚úÖ Optimize for AI agent context windows
‚úÖ Enable faster story creation

Proceed with sharding? (yes/no)
```

#### Step 2.2: Shard PRD

If user confirms, execute shard-doc task:

1. Check `markdownExploder` setting in core-config.yaml
2. If `markdownExploder: true`:
   - Attempt to run: `md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd`
   - If command fails, inform user to install `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
3. If `markdownExploder: false` or command unavailable:
   - Use manual sharding method from shard-doc task
   - Create `docs/prd/` folder
   - Split by level 2 sections
   - Create epic files

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ PRD Sharded Successfully:
- Location: docs/prd/
- Files created: 4 epic files
  - epic-1-foundation-and-core-infrastructure.md
  - epic-2-user-authentication.md
  - epic-3-data-management.md
  - epic-4-reporting-dashboard.md
```

#### Step 2.3: Shard Architecture

Same process for architecture:

1. Execute: `md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture`
2. Or use manual sharding if needed
3. Create component-specific files

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ Architecture Sharded Successfully:
- Location: docs/architecture/
- Files created: 12 component files
  - index.md
  - tech-stack.md
  - unified-project-structure.md
  - data-models.md
  - rest-api-spec.md
  - [etc...]
```

#### Step 2.4: Update Configuration

Update `core-config.yaml` to reflect sharding:

```yaml
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

---

### Phase 3: Story Creation Loop

#### Step 3.1: Initialize Story Tracking

Create tracking structure:

```
üìã Story Creation Progress:

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (6 stories)
  [ ] 1.1 - Project setup and initialization
  [ ] 1.2 - Database configuration
  [ ] 1.3 - Authentication foundation
  [ ] 1.4 - API structure setup
  [ ] 1.5 - Testing framework
  [ ] 1.6 - CI/CD pipeline

Epic 2: User Authentication (5 stories)
  [ ] 2.1 - User signup endpoint
  [ ] 2.2 - User login with JWT
  [... etc ...]

Total: 0/23 stories created
```

#### Step 3.2: Story Creation Loop

For each epic, for each story:

**3.2.1: Invoke SM Story Creation**

Execute the `create-next-story` task with these steps:

1. **Load Core Configuration** - Already loaded in Phase 1

2. **Identify Next Story** - Based on tracking, determine next sequential story

3. **Gather Story Requirements** - Extract from epic file

4. **Gather Architecture Context:**
   - Read architecture index.md
   - Determine story type (Backend/Frontend/Full-Stack)
   - Read relevant architecture files:
     - **For ALL Stories:** tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md
     - **For Backend:** data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md
     - **For Frontend:** frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md
     - **For Full-Stack:** Both Backend and Frontend sections

5. **Extract Story-Specific Technical Details:**
   - Data models for this story
   - API endpoints to implement/consume
   - Component specifications
   - File paths and naming conventions
   - Testing requirements
   - Security/performance considerations
   - ALWAYS include source references: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

6. **Populate Story Template:**
   - Create file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
   - Fill basic info: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, AC from epic
   - **Populate Dev Notes section:**
     - Previous Story Insights
     - Data Models [with sources]
     - API Specifications [with sources]
     - Component Specifications [with sources]
     - File Locations
     - Testing Requirements
     - Technical Constraints
   - **Generate Tasks/Subtasks** based on epic requirements + architecture
   - Link tasks to ACs

7. **Run Story Draft Checklist:**
   - Execute `story-draft-checklist.md`
   - Verify completeness

**3.2.2: Display Story Summary**

```
‚úÖ Story 1.1 Created: Project setup and initialization

Status: Draft
File: .bmad-stories/1.1.story.md

Dev Notes Includes:
  ‚úì Tech Stack: Node.js 18, Express 4.18, PostgreSQL 15
  ‚úì Project Structure: Monorepo with Turborepo
  ‚úì Testing: Jest + Supertest
  ‚úì 8 source references to architecture docs

Tasks Generated: 6 tasks, 15 subtasks
All tasks mapped to acceptance criteria
```

**3.2.3: Mode-Specific Behavior**

- **Full Automation:** Continue to next story immediately
- **Guided Mode:** Ask user to review and confirm before continuing:

  ```
  Review story at .bmad-stories/1.1.story.md

  Continue to next story? (yes/skip epic/cancel)
  ```

- **Selective Mode:** Only process stories user selected

**3.2.4: Update Progress Tracker**

```
üìã Story Creation Progress:

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (6 stories)
  [‚úì] 1.1 - Project setup and initialization
  [‚è≥] 1.2 - Database configuration (in progress...)
  [ ] 1.3 - Authentication foundation
  [... etc ...]

Total: 1/23 stories created (4%)
```

#### Step 3.3: Handle Errors

If story creation fails:

```
‚ùå Error creating story 2.3: User password reset

Error: Missing architecture section: authentication/password-reset.md

Options:
1. Skip this story and continue
2. Pause and let me fix architecture
3. Cancel entire pipeline

What would you like to do? (1-3)
```

---

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration (Optional)

#### Step 4.1: Offer GitHub Creation

After all stories are created:

```
‚úÖ All 23 enriched story files created!

üìÇ Location: .bmad-stories/

Would you like to also create GitHub Issues and Milestones? (yes/no)

Note: Story files are optimized for AI development.
GitHub Issues provide project tracking visibility.
You can create both!
```

#### Step 4.2: Create GitHub Milestones (Epics)

If user confirms, for each epic:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones \
  -f title="Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure" \
  -f description="Establish project setup, authentication, and basic infrastructure" \
  -f due_on="2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
```

#### Step 4.3: Create GitHub Issues (Stories)

For each story:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Story 1.1: Project setup and initialization" \
  --body "As a developer, I want the project initialized with all dependencies...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js project initialized with package.json
- [ ] TypeScript configured
[... etc ...]

## Link to Enriched Story File
Full technical context: .bmad-stories/1.1.story.md

ü§ñ Created by BMAD Automated Story Pipeline" \
  --label "type:story,status:backlog,priority:p1,size:m" \
  --milestone "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure"
```

#### Step 4.4: Link Story Files to Issues

Update each story file with GitHub issue number:

```markdown
# Story 1.1: Project setup and initialization

**GitHub Issue:** #101
**GitHub Milestone:** Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Status: Draft
```

## Configuration Options

The task supports these user preferences:

### Execution Modes

1. **Full Automation** - Create all stories without pausing
2. **Guided Mode** - Pause after each story for review
3. **Selective Mode** - User picks specific epics/stories
4. **Dry Run** - Preview without creating files

### GitHub Integration

- **None** - Only create story files
- **Issues Only** - Create GitHub issues, no milestones
- **Full Integration** - Create milestones and issues, link everything

### Document Handling

- **Auto-shard** - Shard documents automatically if needed
- **Skip sharding** - Work with monolithic documents (slower)
- **Shard only PRD** - Keep architecture monolithic
- **Shard only Architecture** - Keep PRD monolithic

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Issue:** PRD not found

```
Solution: Specify PRD location or create PRD first with PM agent
```

**Issue:** Architecture incomplete

```
Solution: Pause pipeline, complete architecture, resume
```

**Issue:** core-config.yaml missing

```
Solution: Copy from bmad-core-github/core-config.yaml and configure
```

**Issue:** GitHub CLI not authenticated

```
Solution: Run `gh auth login` before GitHub integration
```

**Issue:** Markdown exploder command not found

```
Solution: Install with `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
or set markdownExploder: false in core-config.yaml
```

---

## Success Criteria

The pipeline is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ All PRD epics have corresponding sharded files
2. ‚úÖ All architecture components are sharded
3. ‚úÖ Every story has an enriched .story.md file
4. ‚úÖ All story files include comprehensive Dev Notes with source references
5. ‚úÖ All tasks are mapped to acceptance criteria
6. ‚úÖ Story draft checklist passes for all stories
7. ‚úÖ (Optional) GitHub milestones and issues created
8. ‚úÖ (Optional) Story files linked to GitHub issues
9. ‚úÖ Configuration updated to reflect new structure

---

## Manual Override Options

At any point, user can:

- **Pause:** "Pause the pipeline"
- **Skip:** "Skip current story/epic"
- **Adjust:** "Let me edit the story file before continuing"
- **Cancel:** "Cancel and I'll do it manually"
- **Resume:** "Resume from story X.Y"

---

## Performance Metrics

The task tracks and reports:

- Stories per minute
- Average Dev Notes length
- Source references per story
- Task coverage (% of ACs with tasks)
- Estimated time saved vs manual creation

Example:

```
‚ö° Performance Report:

Stories Created: 23
Time Elapsed: 12 minutes
Average: 1.9 stories/minute

vs Manual SM Creation:
  Estimated manual time: 115 minutes (5 min/story)
  Time saved: 103 minutes (89% faster)

Quality Metrics:
  Avg Dev Notes: 450 words/story
  Avg Source References: 6.2/story
  Task Coverage: 100% (all ACs have tasks)
```

---

## Important Notes

- This task is a **workflow orchestrator** - it calls other tasks but adds automation
- Story quality depends on PRD and Architecture quality - garbage in, garbage out
- The task can be paused/resumed at any point
- All created files are editable - automation is a starting point
- GitHub integration is optional - story files are the primary value
- Use **Guided Mode** for first project, then **Full Automation** once comfortable
