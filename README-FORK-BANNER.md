## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install in your research project
npx @davidkreuzer/bmad-method-ai-research install

# Start researching!
@research-lead
*brainstorm "your research topic"

@research-assistant  # Archon MCP-powered literature search
*search "relevant papers"
```

## ✨ What's Included

This fork includes everything from core BMAD PLUS:

### 🔬 AI Research Expansion Pack
- **7 Specialized Research Agents**
  - 📚 Research Assistant (literature search via Archon MCP)
  - 🔬 Research Lead (brainstorming & strategy)
  - 🧪 Research Scientist (experiment design)
  - ⚙️ ML Engineer (implementation)
  - 📊 Data Analyst (analysis & visualization)
  - ✍️ Research Writer (paper writing)
  - 🔁 Reproducibility Engineer (validation)

### 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ **Automated Literature Search** with Archon MCP
- ✅ **Iterative Research Workflow** (brainstorm → search → refine)
- ✅ **Academic Paper Templates** (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, etc.)
- ✅ **Experiment Management** with reproducibility checks
- ✅ **Statistical Analysis** built-in
- ✅ **Tag-based Paper Organization** in knowledge base

### 📋 Research Workflow

Complete academic research lifecycle:
1. **Planning** - Brainstorm questions + literature search (automated!)
2. **Design** - Experimental architecture + specifications
3. **Implementation** - Code experiments with baselines
4. **Analysis** - Statistical testing + visualization
5. **Writing** - Paper drafting + submission formatting
6. **Publication** - Code release + reproducibility validation

## 🆚 Differences from Core BMAD

| Core BMAD | This Fork |
|-----------|-----------|
| Software development focus | AI/ML research focus |
| PRD → Features → Code | Proposal → Experiments → Paper |
| Not included | ✅ 7 research agents included |
| Not included | ✅ Archon MCP integration |
| Not included | ✅ Academic templates |
| Not included | ✅ Research workflows |

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
# 1. Initial brainstorming
@research-lead
*brainstorm "sparse attention mechanisms"

# 2. Search knowledge base (Archon MCP)
@research-assistant
*set-tag "transformer-research"
*search "attention mechanisms"

# 3. Refine based on gaps (iterate 2-4 times)
@research-lead
*brainstorm "sparse attention"

# 4. Create proposal
@research-lead
*create-proposal

# 5. Design experiments
@research-scientist
*design-experiment

# 6. Implement
@ml-engineer
*implement-experiment

# 7. Analyze
@data-analyst
*analyze-results

# 8. Write paper
@research-writer
*create-paper
```
